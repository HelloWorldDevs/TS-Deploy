#This file is an example of the siteConfig.py file you will need to configure your deployment script. Simply add the correct user name, password, machine name, and ip address for your site on webFaction. Then, add a website name (no underscores allowed) and a url to the repo (use the https url, not the ssl address). Feel free to do that here and rename this file to get started.

#Webfaction User Information
userName = "user"
userPass = "1234password"
machineName = "Wf-198-58-114-22"
ipAddress = "198.58.114.22"

#Website Information
websiteName = "foobar"
repoUrl = "https://github.com/HelloWorldDevs/foobar.git"
